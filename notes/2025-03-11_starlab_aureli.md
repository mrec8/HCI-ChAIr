- Martí begins
- explains project, controlling wheelchair
- we are researching SOTA
- which kind of headgear to use
- Andreu mentioned the possibility of collaborating with you
11:37
- zach asks if motor imagery is the right usage
- aureli:
	- classic usage of motor imagery
		- often poor success
			- but still good to try again
		- several datasets that are open to use
		- bci competitions
		- the good news is we can compare our model with the state of the art
- martí:
	- why do you think motor imagery control has not been successful
	- I didn't have this feeling from the literature
- aureli
	- other types are visual / evoked stimuli
		- answering to evoked stimuli
	- difficult because of inter- and intra-subject 
- benjamin blankhertz ??
	- interesting discussion on this
11:40
- martí:
	- we thought of solving inter=person variability by having a model that can be trained
- bruno:
	- more customizable because the user can choose the way they want to control
- aureli:
	- this is the classic strategy
- bruno:
	- is motor imagery the best strategy?
- aureli:
	- it's worth doing
	- is this a master thesis
11:44
- zach: as this is an HCI project, we are doing surveys, designing the interface itself, focusing on the customizability
- aureli:
	- not aware of any studies that have reached the wheelchair control phase
	- EPFL studies (not in spain)
- martí:
	- I have seen promising publications on motor imagery. why is it difficult?
	- what do you do at starlabs?
- aureli
	- it is difficult to sell BCI for controlling (active BCI)
	- much more focused on BCI on effective computing, response to external stimuli (passive BCI)
	- we have been approached recently for neuro-prosthetic control
	- using an exoskeleton to understand motor imagery
	- understanding the moment in which they want to use their limbs
	- approached by a ukrainian entrepaneur
		- would like to control hand prosthetics
	- company in madrid
		- would like to control exoskeletons
- marti
	- does your headset offer the raw EEG signals?
		- yes
	- this is a drawback to many of the headsets offered on the market
	- how have these projects been? (controlling exoskeletons)
- aureli
	- it's possible to detect motor intention
	- it's a matter of the level of performance for several subjects
- andreu
	- is motor control a good area of research?
		- yes
- aureli
	- there are very few people who are quadriplegic
	- it might make sense to focus on prosthetics
- zach:
	- is there a project in between the simplicity of wheelchair control and the complexity of hand prosthetic control
- aureli
	- there may not be something in between
	- we have not worked with lower limb control
	- one challenge is that exoskeletons and prosthetics are expensive
- bruno
	- we are intending to use a virtual simulation at this stage
	- electric wheelchair would also be very expensive
- marti
	- there are virtual environments we could use, e.g. opengym
- aureli
	- I don't know open gym
	- openvibe [https://openvibe.inria.fr/](https://openvibe.inria.fr/)
- zach
	- how does the exoskeleton
- aureli
	- lower limb control, movement detection
	- we are interested in a dataset of lower limb detection of 20-30 people
- marti
	- probably those without control of the lower limbs
- aureli
	- haven't seen the use case of wheelchair
- zach
	- use case of exoskeleton
- aureli
	- for those with impairments in the lower limbs
	- helping those who are paraplegic
	- there's a spinoff from UPC working on helping paraplegics
	- also for rehabilitation
- bruno
	- how would collaboration work
- aureli
	- up to andreu but
	- we would sign a collaboration agreement
		- we agree to provide data
	- the team receiving the device would be responsible
- zach
	- the idea of collaborating is interesting
	- we will need to discuss more
- aureli
	- what is the timeline
		- till may, 2 months
	- we have to check that the device is available
	- maybe it's not needed for all 2 months
	- just for data gathering, and for presentation
- andreu
	- we could begin with existing BCI data, from competitions
- aureli
	- defining the protocol is difficult
		- in order to use the data afterwards
- andreu
	- it's probably best to begin with existing data
- zach
	- would it be OK to only use existing data and not have a working demo
		- andreu: yes
- aureli
	- it's not easy in 2 months to prototype something
12:10
- andreu
	- do you have the link for the BCI competition?
- aureli
	- yes there are several

	- when you are doing a literature review, you will find more datasets
